A Search Component made with react and typescript.

The layout was inspired in the Bento UI Design, which is an aproach about visual hierarchy and organization. It offers a clean, efficient design structure that's visually appealing. Its real power comes from its adaptability to small, rectangular layouts, making it a godsend for mobile-responsive designs.
